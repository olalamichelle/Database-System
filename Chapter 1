# Chapter 1: The world of DB Systems

You: Request info from a website 
Database of that website: serving the information you request

database is empowered by DBMS or DB systems

DBMS:
	Create and preserve large amount of data over a long period of time
	Manage data: update, insert, delete
	More specifically, DBMS can:
		- allow user to create new DB and specify their schemas using a specialized DDL
		- give user the ability to query the data and modify the data using an appropriate language often called a query language or DML
		- Support the storage of very large amount of data (terabytes or more) over a long period of time, allowing efficient access to the data for queries and database modifications
		- enable durability, the recovery of the DB in the face of failures, errors of many kinds or intentional misuse
		- control access to data from many users at once
			* Isolation: without allowing unexpected interactions among users
			* Atomicaity: without actions on the data to be performed partially but not completely
