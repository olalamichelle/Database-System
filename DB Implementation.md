Let's jump right into it. 

Where we're at now is that we spent the first two lectures talking about sort of high level things, like what a relational model is and how you write queries against data stored like that. And that was all sort of lofty in terms of high level and abstract. We didn't describe anything about how we actually would implement code that could do those particular things.
So at this point of course, this is where we sort of jumping to now describing how you would actually build software to execute queries on a relational database system. So that is really what the next, pretty much from now until Thanksgiving, the things we were gonna be talking about. So if you go back to the cource outline that I showed in the first class.

** We have learn what a DB looks like at a logic level and how to write queires to read/write from it. 
We will now learn how to build software that manages a DB.**
